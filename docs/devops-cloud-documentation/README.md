This project documents the Explaining DevOps & Cloud Concepts in Plain Language Assessment. I chose the CI/CD DevOps concept and did my best to explain it in the way a non-technical person can understand.

## What I Learned
- I gained a clear understanding of the difference between CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment), and why both are important in modern development workflows.
- I learned how to restructure a Docker Compose file and adapt a tutorial into a simpler, more streamlined format.
