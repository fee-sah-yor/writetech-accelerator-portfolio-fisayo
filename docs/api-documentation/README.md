## What I Improved
- Better Structure:
The original documentation placed everything on a single page, requiring long scrolling.
I introduced clear sections and navigation to improve usability.

- Visual Examples:
Added screenshots of Postman requests and responses to help developers quickly see what results look like.
Visuals make testing and debugging faster.

## Challenges
- Generating the YML file and figuring out how to render it on the docusaurus site
- Structuring documentation so that it remains easy to navigate even as content grows.

## What I Learnt
- I learned that structured documentation is important to help users quickly understand and navigate content. This structure can be achieved in several waysâ€”such as including images to demonstrate outcomes, using colors to highlight key information, and simplifying language wherever possible. The ultimate goal of documentation is to explain concepts as clearly as possible. With this project, my focus was on making the documentation easy to follow for both beginners and professionals.
