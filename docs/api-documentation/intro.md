# Introduction

## What is the Unsplash API?

The **Unsplash API** is a public REST API that gives developers access to millions of high-quality, freely usable images contributed by photographers around the world. Unsplash started as a small platform for sharing beautiful photos, but today it has grown into a global community of over **250,000 photographers**, powering **billions of searches** across countless applications and websites such as **Medium, Notion, and Trello**.
