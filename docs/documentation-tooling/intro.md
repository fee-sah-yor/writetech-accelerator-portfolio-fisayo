# Product Intro

First impressions matter — and your onboarding screen is often the very first interaction users have with your app.  

**[React Native Onboarding Swiper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-onboarding-swiper?activeTab=readme)** is a lightweight, easy-to-use library that helps you create smooth, swipeable onboarding screens in minutes.  

Every app benefits from a clear and engaging onboarding flow. With this library, you can quickly set up and customize slides to match your app’s style and branding.  

It’s just one component, fully customizable, giving you complete control to design an onboarding experience that feels natural, engaging, and uniquely yours.  

Created in 2017 by Jan Filter ([@jfilter](https://github.com/jfilter)), the project is actively maintained and widely adopted in the React Native community. You can explore the source code, documentation, and contribute to the project here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jfilter/react-native-onboarding-swiper).
