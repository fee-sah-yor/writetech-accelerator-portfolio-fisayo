# Getting Started With React Native Onboarding Swiper

**React Native Onboarding Swiper** is a lightweight and easy-to-use library that helps you add smooth, swipeable onboarding screens to your React Native app.

---

## Installation

To get started, install the library using **npm** or **yarn**:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install react-native-onboarding-swiper

# Using yarn
yarn add react-native-onboarding-swiper
```

## TypeScript Support

If you are using TypeScript, you may need to configure type definitions.

1. First, try installing community types (if available):

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev @types/react-native-onboarding-swiper
```

2. If no official types exist, create a new declaration file (e.g., react-native-onboarding-swiper.d.ts) in your projectâ€™s @types/ folder with the following content:
```bash
# Using npm
declare module 'react-native-onboarding-swiper';

```
This ensures TypeScript recognizes the module.
