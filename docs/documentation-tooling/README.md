## Challenges

- [Challenge 2]

## What I Learnt
- The importance of having a well structured documentation. when creatung this it was easy for me to see from the users POV becaus ei had been in their shoes when using this aprticular library so i made sure to address those painpoints when creating this dcoumentation.
- Videos, Images or coding snipppets are one of the most crucial aprts o f any documentation, they show that the users needs were peoperly considered and accounted for, that was my aim. with this documentation. They also quickly convey the message without using too many words.
