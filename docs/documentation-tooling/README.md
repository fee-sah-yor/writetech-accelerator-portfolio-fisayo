## What I Improved
- Created a clear and structured documentation to help users understand what the library does, as there was no proper documentation prior to this.
- Added a tutorial example with screenshots, allowing users to see results directly without leaving the documentation page.
- Restructured the documentation to improve readability and navigation, making it easier for beginners to learn about the product.

## Challenges
- Understanding the library from a beginner's perspective and identifying what users might find confusing, since the original documentation was sparse.
- Structuring the documentation in a way that balances detailed explanations with visual examples, ensuring it is both informative and easy to navigate.


## What I Learned
- A well-structured documentation is essential. Creating this documentation helped me see the library from the user's perspective and address common pain points effectively.
- Including videos, images, and code snippets is crucial. These elements quickly convey information, demonstrate use cases, and ensure that user needs are properly considered and addressed.
