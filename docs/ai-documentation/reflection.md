## Reflection

I improved and polished the output by removing unnecessary descriptions. The previous AI model’s response looked less like an outline because it included details that normally don’t belong in one. I cleared those and reformatted the structure with bullet points and numbered lists. This makes it easier to recognize as an outline at first glance, unlike the earlier version.
