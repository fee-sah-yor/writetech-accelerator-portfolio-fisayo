# ChatGPT Model Card

This model card provides a structured overview of the GPT-4o model. It is designed to help both beginners and technical readers understand what the model is, how it works, what it was trained on, how it is evaluated, and the potential risks involved.

---

## 1. Model Details

- **Model Name**: GPT-4o  
- **Version**: 4.0  
- **Developer**: OpenAI  
- **Model Type**: Multimodal large language model  

GPT-4o is an autoregressive multimodal model. It accepts inputs in text, audio, images, and video, and generates outputs in text, audio, and images. Unlike earlier models, GPT-4o processes all modalities through a single neural network, making it faster and more efficient across multiple input types.

## 2. Purpose & Intended Use

### Primary Use Cases
- Brainstorming & Creative Writing  
- Knowledge Retrieval & Summarization  
- Coding & Debugging Assistance  
- General Content Generation  

### Out-of-Scope Uses
- Medical, Legal, or Financial Advice  
- Illegal, Harmful, or Unethical Content  
- Real-Time or Post-Cutoff Information  

---

## 3. Training Data

GPT-4o was trained using data collected up to **October 2023**. Training involved a wide range of publicly available and licensed materials.  

- **Data Sources**: Internet text, licensed data, and other large-scale corpora.  
- **Data Scope**: Content ranging from math problems to reasoning tasks, covering diverse ideologies, languages, and writing styles.  
- **Training Cutoff**: October 2023 (no knowledge of events or data after this date).

## 4. Metrics & Evaluation  

GPT-4o has been evaluated using a combination of **technical performance benchmarks**, **safety and alignment tests**, and **user engagement metrics**.  

### Technical Metrics  
- **Perplexity:** This measures how well the model predicts the next word.  
- **Accuracy:** It is evaluated across professional and academic benchmarks in reasoning, coding, and language tasks.  

### Safety & Alignment Metrics  
Post-training adjustments and system filters were applied to reduce harmful or misleading behavior, including:  
- **Toxicity scores** (measuring harmful language output)  
- **Helpfulness and harmlessness ratings** (ensuring responses are useful and safe)  
- **Audio safeguards** (blocking unauthorized voice generation, disallowed speech, or misuse of speaker identification)  
- **Content filters** to avoid generating copyrighted or disallowed material  

### User Engagement Metrics  
- **Response Time:** GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 ms (average 320 ms), approaching human conversational speed.  
- **Session Length & Feedback:** User studies and live feedback are used to assess satisfaction and engagement across use cases.

## 5. Risks & Limitations

Like previous models, GPT-4o comes with risks:  

- **Factual Inaccuracy (Hallucinations)**: The model may generate incorrect or misleading information.  
- **Bias**: Outputs may reflect biases present in training data.  
- **Outdated Knowledge**: The model does not know anything beyond October 2023.  
- **Misuse Potential**: The model could be used to generate harmful, unethical, or illegal content if not properly controlled.
