# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains ‚Äî including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 ‚Äî using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm Fisayo Afowowe, a technical writer with a background in web development, combining strong technical knowledge with clear, structured communication. I enjoy creating user-friendly documentation, tutorials, and guides that bridge the gap between complex technology and practical understanding. Through technical writing, I aim to support product adoption, improve developer experiences, and contribute to impactful projects. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I‚Äôve built during the WriteTech Accelerator Program.
